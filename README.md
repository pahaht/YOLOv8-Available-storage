# YOLOv8-Available-storage

### *Overview*
The YOLOv8 model is utilized to detect and localize areas where storage space is available in images or video streams.
The model is trained on a dataset containing images with labeled available storage areas. Once trained, 
the model can be used to identify and mark available storage spaces in real-time.
